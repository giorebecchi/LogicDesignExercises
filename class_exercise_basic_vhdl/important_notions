how to compile and run tests:
 ghdl -a "resource_file.vhd" [OPTIONAL] "testbench_file.vhd"
 [OPTIONAL] ghdl -e "testbench_name" (no .vhd)
 ghdl -r "testbench_name" (no .vhd) --vcd="choose_file_name.vcd" [OPTIONAL] --stop-time=(choose time)
 gtkwave "choose_file_name.vcd"


Things to remember when doing the testbench_file:

    define the signals that you want to test and the clock signal.

    when I want to assign a vector:

        if I defined the vector as "vec : in STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(n downto 0)" 
        then to assign the first element (index = 0) -> vec <= "XXX1". where X is an Unknown value.

    when I want to test the outputs:

        1. assign the inputs (always remember the rising_edge()!!).
        2. wait for a few clock cycles.
        3. check the outputs.

end of things to remember;

Things to remember when doing the resource_file:

    define always three processes:

        1. To switch from present_state to next_state for every clock cycle.
        2. To follow the state machine transitions.
        3. To assign the outputs based on the present_state.

    when I want to access a vector:

        if I defined the vector as "vec : in STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(n downto 0)" then to access the first element (index = 0 )-> vec(3).

        when I'm assigning outputs:

            1. always assing the output at the beginning of the process.
            2. then use the case statement to assign the output based on the present_state (with a default assignment and not just inside an if).
